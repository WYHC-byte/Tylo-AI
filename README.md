  <strong>More than an AI. It's your pocket-sized partner for creation, learning, and play.</strong>

  <strong>它不是冰冷的工具，而是口袋中的未来伙伴。</strong>

## 🚀 About Us

TyloAI is a lab dedicated to redefining the relationship between Gen Z and artificial intelligence. Our flagship product, **TyloAI (JorkAI in Mainland China)**, is an AI-native platform designed from the ground up to be fun, intuitive, and deeply integrated into the digital lives of young creators, learners, and explorers.

We believe the future of AI isn't just about answering questions. It's about building relationships, sparking curiosity, and empowering the next generation to build the future.

## ✨ Core Features (核心特性)

Our platform is more than just a wrapper around a single model. It's a complex, fine-tuned ecosystem designed for a superior experience.

* 🧠 **Unified Cognitive Hub (统一认知中枢 - Ode-6 Architecture)**
    * Intelligently routes prompts to the best model (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, etc.).
    * Features **Reasoning-while-Searching** technology. While other AIs are waiting for search results, ours is already thinking and delivering answers at lightning speed.

* 🔍 **Crystal Box Thinking (水晶盒思维 - 可视化思考)**
    * No more black boxes. We visualize the AI's thought process (`<think>` tags), turning a monologue into a transparent dialogue.

* ✍️ **AI Self-Correction (AI 自我修正 - "后悔药")**
    * Powered by our `replace_message` tool, the AI can review and correct its own past responses in real-time, making conversations more accurate and dynamic.

* ❤️ **Persistent Memory & Persona (持久化记忆与人格)**
    * Our AI remembers your preferences, key phrases, and past conversations, creating a truly personalized experience. "This AI gets me!"
    * Generate and share your unique **AI Persona Card** on social media.

* 🎭 **Customizable Tones (可定制语气)**
    * Go beyond the default. Switch between tones like "Girlfriend" or even the infamous "Toxic" (`嘴臭`) mode for a hilarious and engaging chat experience.

* 🎓 **AI Knowledge Certification (AI 知识认证)**
    * A built-in, gamified learning system that rewards users with beautifully designed certificates and a free 1-year Student Plan. We sell confidence, not just knowledge.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (技术栈)

This project is built with a modern, scalable, and efficient technology stack.

* **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, running on Vercel Serverless Functions
* **Database:** Supabase / Vercel KV / PlanetScale
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Payments:** Stripe & WeChat Pay
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 💖 Our Philosophy (我们的哲学)

1.  **Experience > Specs (体验 > 参数):** The public doesn't care if it's GPT-4 or GPT-5. They care about the experience. We focus on innovative features that create "wow" moments.
2.  **From Black Box to Crystal Box (从黑盒到水晶盒):** We believe transparency builds trust. We strive to make the AI's inner workings as understandable as possible.
3.  **The One-Screen Rule (一块屏幕的距离):** "A developer at a big company is separated from the user by 10 reporting layers. Me? I'm separated by just one screen." This is our core advantage. We are our users, we build for our users, and we listen to our users without friction.
